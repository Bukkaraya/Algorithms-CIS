This assignment contains 4 programs P11.c, P12.c, P21.c, P22.c. 

To compile all programs run:

make all 

To clean files:

make clean

Q1.1) Brute Force implementation of number of inversions

To run the program:
./P11

To run the program with a different dataset:
./P11 <your_datafile>.txt

The program will prompt for the number of elements in the array. For the provided dataset data1.txt, the number of elements is 50000;

For the dataset data4.txt, the number of elements is 100000.

Q1.2) Optimized implementation of inversions

This program is run similar to the brute force version Q1.1.

./P12
or
./P12 <your_datafile>.txt

The program will prompt for the number of elements in the array. 

Q2.1) Brute Force implementation of Convex Hull

To run this program:
./P21
To run with a custom dataset:
./P21 <your_datafile>.txt

Q2.2) QuickHull implementation of Convex Hull

To run this program:
./P22
To run with a custom dataset:
./P22 <your_datafile>.txt

data1.txt is the provided dataset for the inversion problem.
data2.txt is the provided dataset for the convex hull problem.
